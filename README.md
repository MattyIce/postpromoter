```

### Blacklist
You can add a list of blacklisted users whose bids will not be accepted and who will not receive any refund by adding their steem account name to the "blacklist" file. Set the "blacklist_location" property to point to the location of your blacklist file, or you can use a URL to point to a shared blacklist on the internet. The file should contain only one steem account name on each line and nothing else as in the following example:

```
blacklisted_account_1
blacklisted_account_2
blacklisted_account_3
```

Additionally you can add a list of "flag_signal_accounts" which means that if any accounts on that list have flagged the post at the time the bid is sent then the bot will treat it as blacklisted.

## Run
```
$ nodejs postpromoter.js
```

This will run the process in the foreground which is not recommended. We recommend using a tool such as [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to run the process in the background as well as providing many other great features.

## API Setup
If you would like to use the API functionality set the "api.enabled" setting to "true" and choose a port. You can test if it is working locally by running:

```
$ curl http://localhost:port/api/bids
```

If that returns a JSON object with bids then it is working.

It is recommended to set up an nginx reverse proxy server (or something similar) to forward requests on port 80 to the postpromoter nodejs server. For instructions on how to do that please see: https://medium.com/@utkarsh_verma/configure-nginx-as-a-web-server-and-reverse-proxy-for-nodejs-application-on-aws-ubuntu-16-04-server-872922e21d38

In order to be used on the bot tracker website it will also need an SSL certificate. For instructions to get and install a free SSL certificate see: https://certbot.eff.org/
